# Udacity-Save-and-Restore-Trained-Model
We spent much time on training a model. When you are satisfied with the training result, don't forget to save the model. 
So you don't need to repeat the process to train the model again. 
This repo is a guide through on how to save a trained Neural Networks model and restore its weights, bias variables and the entire model.
